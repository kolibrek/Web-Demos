Web-Demos
=========

A collection of demos for instruction and ease of reference!

=========
The first demo is for thumbnails and a lightbox popup.  To get the same functionality in your own website, copy the "js" folder into your website's folder, and copy the "css/thumbnails.css" file as well.  Then in the page in which you want thumbnails create a div tag with the image-set class and copy the structure of everything inside the figure tag as seen in thumbnail.html.  Replace all the image sources with your own images, including the image inside the popup!
